# React Native examples

The examples in this directory demonstrate how to use TalkJS with React Native to create a basic app:

- [ReactNavigationExample](./ReactNavigationExample/) uses the [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started/) library to navigate between screens
- [ReactNativeNavigationExample](./ReactNativeNavigationExample/) uses the [React Native Navigation](https://wix.github.io/react-native-navigation/docs/before-you-start/) library
