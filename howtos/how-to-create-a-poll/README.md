This is an example project on how to create a poll with TalkJS.

This project uses HTML Panels to allow you to display a HTML document in your chats, just above the message field. We’ll use a panel to display the results of a poll, where users voted using custom action buttons. The question in this poll is sent as a System Message. This System Message is created through a call to a backend server through TalkJS’s REST API.
