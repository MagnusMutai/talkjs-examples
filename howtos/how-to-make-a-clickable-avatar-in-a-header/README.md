This is an example project for TalkJS's tutorial on how to make a clickable link to the userâ€™s profile.

This project uses TalkJS's [custom header feature](https://talkjs.com/docs/Features/Customizations/Creating_Custom_Headers/). The custom header in this example contains a link that leads to user's profile page.

The frontend fetches the data from a backend ExpressJS server that returns the list of users, the information about the current user and the current template.

## Prerequisites

- A [TalkJS account](https://talkjs.com/dashboard/login)
