This project passes custom data to multiple TalkJS chatboxes. Then, we use the custom data to modify a newly created [TalkJS Theme](https://talkjs.com/docs/Features/Themes/).

## Prerequisites

To run this tutorial, you will need:

- A [TalkJS account](https://talkjs.com/dashboard/login)

## How to run the tutorial

1. Clone or download this project.
2. Go to `index.js`, and replace <YOUR_APP_ID> with your app ID from the TalkJS dashboard.
3. Go to your TalkJS dashboard and navigate to the **Themes** tab. Create a new theme called "customDataToTheme" based on the "default" theme. The project adds the default role to all users in the chat.
4. Edit the theme as per the instructions in the article.
